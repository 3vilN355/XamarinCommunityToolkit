# Effects

Effects allow the native controls on each platform to be customized, and are typically used for small styling changes.

The Forms Community Toolkit has effects for these types of controls:

 - Entry
 - Label
 - Picker
 - Switch
 - View

More info on effects can be found in the [official Xamarin documentation](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/effects/introduction/).
